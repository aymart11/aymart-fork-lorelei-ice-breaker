I was on my way to the Flughafen in a taxi that had no klimaanlarge!
As I sat there sweating and cursing my luck, I suddenly spotted a random guy strolling down the street in a Dirndl.
It looked as though he was making his way down to Hauptstrasse to purchase some delicious Bratwurst.
I was hungry so I asked the taxi to drop me here as I was going to order the man got into his Bmw and offered me a ride to his Schloss.
